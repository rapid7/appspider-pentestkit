# pentestkit

Penetration Testing Kit features:

1) Dashboard - With information about client/server technologies, like Wappalyzer our PenTestKit extension can give you the same information and even more. You can see request/response information and then execute them again in request builder.

2) Request Builder - Need to check what happens if you send a SQL injection or XSS attack? Just use this request builder, modify the parameters, execute the request and check it right in your Chrome browser.

3) Recorder - This part of the extension is really good for InsightAppSec or AppSpider Enterprise users. You can record a macro and modify it right here if you need any changes, then copy or download the recorded macro and upload into directly InsightAppSec or AppSpider Enterprise. You also can record a traffic and export it as a HAR file and use for traffic authentication in AppSec products.

4) OWASP Security Headers - We do check for security headers like X-XSS-Protection or X-Content-Type-Options.

# pentestkit

Penetration Testing Kit features:

1) Request Builder - Need to check what happens if you send a SQL injection or XSS attack? Just use this request builder, modify the parameters, execute the request and check it right in your Chrome browser.

2) Macro and traffic recorder - This part of the extension is really good for InsightAppSec or AppSpider Enterprise users. You can record a macro and modify it right here if you need any changes, then copy or download the recorded macro and upload into directly InsightAppSec or AppSpider Enterprise. You also can record a traffic and export it as a HAR file and use for traffic authentication in AppSec products.

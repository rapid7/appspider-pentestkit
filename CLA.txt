		Contributor License Agreement

Denis Podgurskiy requires external contributors to sign a 
Contributor License Agreement ("CLA"). 

 Copyright (C) 2021 Denis Podgurskiy (aka Denis Podgurskii)

## Human-Friendly Summary

This is a human-readable summary of (and not a substitute for) the
full agreement below. This highlights only some of key terms of the
CLA. It has no legal value and you should carefully review all the
terms of the actual CLA before agreeing (Legal Terms and Agreement
below).

* Grant of copyright license. You give Denis Podgurskiy and Rapid7, Inc. 
  permission to use your copyrighted work in commercial products.

* Grant of patent license. If your contributed work uses a patent, you
  give Denis Podgursky and Rapid7, Inc. a license to use that patent including 
  within commercial products. You also agree that you have permission to 
  grant this license.

* No Warranty or Support Obligations. By making a contribution, you
  are not obligating yourself to provide support for the contribution,
  and you are not taking on any warranty obligations or providing any
  assurances about how it will perform. 

## Why Require a CLA?

Agreeing to a CLA explicitly states that you are entitled to provide a
contribution, that you cannot withdraw permission to use your
contribution at a later date, and that Denis Podgurskiy has
permission to use your contribution in commercial products.

This removes any ambiguities or uncertainties caused by not having a
CLA and allows users and customers to confidently adopt our
projects. At the same time, the CLA ensures that all contributions to
our open source projects are licensed under the project's respective
open source license.

# Signing the CLA

This CLA documents the rights granted by contributors to Denis Podgursky. 
Prior to downloading, using, distributing, incorporating, or making any 
changes, modifications, or contributions, please sign this document and 
send it to Denis Podgurskiy by email to denis.podgurskiy@gmail.com. This is a legally 
binding agreement, so please read it carefully before agreeing to it. In order to clarify
the intellectual property license granted with contributions from any person 
or entity, Denis Podgurskiy must have a CLA on file that has been signed by each 
contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license does 
not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.

# Legal Terms and Agreement

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your
present and future Contributions submitted to Denis Podgursky and Rapid7.
Except for the license granted herein to Denis Podgursky and Rapid7 and 
recipients of software distributed by Denis Podgursky and Rapid7, 
You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

1. Definitions. "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or
   legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this
   Agreement with Rapid7. For legal entities, the entity making a
   Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled
   by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to
   be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition,
   "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship,
   including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that
   is or previously has been intentionally submitted by You to
   Denis Podgurskiy for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the
   products owned or managed by Denis Podgurskiy (the "Work"). For the
   purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of
   electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Denis Podgursky, 
   including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, 
   source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, 
   or on behalf of, Denis Podgursky and Rapid7 for the purpose of discussing and 
   improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked 
   or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this Agreement, You hereby grant to Denis Podgurskiy and Rapid7, Inc. ("Rapid7") 
   and to recipients of software distributed by Denis Podgurskiy and Rapid7 a 
   perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright
   license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
   display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your
   Contributions and such derivative works.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this Agreement, You hereby grant to Denis Podgurskiy and Rapid7 and 
   to recipients of software distributed by Denis Podgurskiy and Rapid7 
   a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable 
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,
   offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
   such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You
   that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by
   combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
   Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent
   litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim
   or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or
   the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or
   contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted
   to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work
   shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above
   license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property
   that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent
   that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf
   of that employer, that you will have received permission from your
   current and future employers for all future Contributions, that
   your applicable employer has waived such rights for all of your
   current and future Contributions to Denis Podgurskiy, or that your
   employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with Denis Podgurskiy.

5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original
   creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You
   represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete
   details of any third-party license or other restriction (including,
   but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you
   are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your
   Contributions.

6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,
   except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide
   support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by
   applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your
   Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
   OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
   limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-
   INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation,
   You may submit it to Denis Podgurskiy separately from any Contribution,
   identifying the complete details of its source and of any license
   or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related
   patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are
   personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted
   on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

8. You agree to notify Denis Podgurskiy of any facts or circumstances of
   which you become aware that would make these representations
   inaccurate in any respect.
